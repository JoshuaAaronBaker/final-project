# Spotify-By-Me

A React application made for users who want a have a differnt experience with Spotify.

## Why I Built This

I made this application because I wanted to create a more colorful and minimalistic experience for a Spotify like application.
I also wanted to add some extra stat tracking features which are not in the original app, because we all have fun with the end
of the year Spotify Wrapped, so why not have access all the time.
